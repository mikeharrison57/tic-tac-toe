// A Game should include:

// A way to keep track of the data for the game board
// have two arrays to keep track of wins and ties. Need wins to update
// win counter on DOM eventually.


// A way to check the Gameâ€™s board data for win conditions
// Need array of win conditions. Loop through array to have it
// trigger a win when one of the players has won.

// A way to detect when a game is a draw (no one has won)
// Conditionals for if all spaces on the grid are full. If all the spaces
// are full, then the game will result in a draw, not update wins, and game
// will reset.

// and update win counter if a player has won
